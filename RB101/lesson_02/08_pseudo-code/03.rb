# 2. Write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) for a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together.

=begin
Informal
  - create an empty string variable
  - set an iterator to 0
  - iterate through an array of strings
  - add each value (string) to the empty string
  - print the new string
=end

=begin
Formal

START

  SET empty string called new_string

  SET method
    use .each method to iterate through array, accepting a parameter |word|
    use .push method to add each |word| to new_tring

END

=end
